## Objective

Create a travel itinerary between four points.
*  These points are to be determined by first selecting 2000 random latitudes and longitudes, finding the city name of these points, and finding a hotel within 5000 meters of the Lat/Long pair. 
*  Using Google Maps Directions service, plot a tour between these points for travel, in this case, driving. 
*  In addition to the geographic information and lodging, provide current weather conditions and maximum temperature of the start/end and waypoints.
